# Building

We use **Tauri** which requires **_[some extra setup]_**.

Be sure to clone this repo with **submodules:**
  * `git clone --recursive https://github.com/LucidVR/opengloves-ui.git` 
  * If this doesn't clone the submodules correctly, or to download them after cloning the repo, try `git submodule update --init --recursive`   

## Sidecar

The interface uses **Sidecar** as it's backend for communication <br>
with **OpenVR** and must be built first for the project to run.

1. Navigate to `/sidecar/`.

2. **Create** & **Enter** a folder named `build`.

3. Run CMake with:

   ```sh
   cmake ..
   ```

4. Open the generated **Visual Studio** project.

5. **Build** the project in a `Release` / `MinSizeRel` mode.

6. Copy the build **Artifacts** into `/src-tauri/`.
   - `sidecar-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc.exe`
   - `openvr_api.dll`

<br>

## Building the Application

1. Have **[Sidecar]** built.

2. Install dependencies with:

   ```sh
   yarn install
   ```

3. Launch the development server with:

   ```sh
   yarn run dev
   ```

   _The initial run may take a significant amount of time._

4. Build the interface with:

   ```sh
   yarn run build
   ```

   **_Artifacts_** _will be placed in `src-tauri/targets/release`._ <br>
   _An_ **_Installer_** _is located in `src-tauri/targets/release/bundle-msi`_

<br>

##### Note

Using the **Installer** will automatically install `Webview2`.

If you only plan on distributing the **UI** & **Sidecar** <br>
binaries, you will have to manually install [`Webview2`].
